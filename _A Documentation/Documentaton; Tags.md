## Tag Formatting
There are guidelines to how tags must be formatted:
- Text should not be capitalised, unless it is an acronym.
- Any special characters, apart from emojis, are disallowed.
## Growth Tags
Files in this vault can take several different **growth stages**, being:
1. Seed: #🌰
2. Sapling: #🌱
3. Young: #🪴
4. Mature: #🌳
5. Fruiting: #🍎

These **growth stages** indicate at what stage of development that file is at. The further *growth* that they have undergone, the more readable, understandable, and informative that note will be.
### Seed
**Seed** files are the most basic of the files. They exist simply to faciliate hyperlinks and serve as an indication of what information has to be added to the vault. [[Documentation; Tags; Seed Example]] is a perfect example of a seed file. 

Some characteristics of seed files would be:
- Only includes a template
- Is completely empty

Some seed files will serve no purpose. These seed files should be flagged for deletion or simply ignored
