## Tag Formatting
There are guidelines to how tags must be formatted:
- Text should not be capitalised, unless it is an acronym.
- Any special characters, apart from emojis, are disallowed.
## Growth Tags
Files in this vault can take several different **growth stages**, being:
2. Sapling: #🌱
4. Mature: #🌳
5. Fruiting: #🍎

These **growth stages** indicate at what stage of development that file is at. The further *growth* that they have undergone, the more readable, understandable, and informative that note will be.
