# 10LIT - Task 1; Section 1
**Origins**: The Victorian age was a period of literature and art that was brought about due to Queen Victoria's rule, hence the name, and the sudden Industrial Revolution; commonly agreed to have ranged somewhere between 1798 to 1832. It signified a turn from Romantic literature, being more objectivist and focusing more on the lives of ordinary people at the time. The Victorian age is often regarded as the Golden Age of English literature, and is characterised by an influx in prose fiction, contrasted to the predominance of poetry in early periods of literature. 

**Prevailing Principles**: Victorian literature commonly depicts the difficulty and hardness of industrial life in which hard work, and perseverance wins in the end. It also explores British Imperialism; work and the middle class; industrliasation; and a pessismism towards religion and spirituality.
