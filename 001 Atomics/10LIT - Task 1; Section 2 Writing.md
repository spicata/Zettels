# 10LIT - Task 1; Section 2 Writing
Black drops of rain fell from dark, foreboding clouds as they rolled in, plunging the town into a great darkness; plants mourning the sun. Chimneys ==exhaling== smoke, mixing and blending into the ~~clouds~~ as the drifted up, allowing the occasional dying ember to float out, only to be smited by volley of heavy, large droplets. Horses and dogs becoming amorphous beasts as they melded into the shadows. Along with the foot passengers, they became a congealed mass, moving rhythmatically, completely apathetic towards the ==unfavourable== weather. The river of unidentifiable masses flowed around corners, through intersections, into buildings, all going somewhere. There was conversation, barking, neighing, but it was all eclipsed by the sychronous clanging of iron picks on the hard, cold, rock ground, reverberating throughout the town.

A wave of down-troddened, demoralised miners flowed out of the coal mines as their shifts ended, covered in mud and sweat and soot, and carrying the scent of brimstone along with them, dispersing into the crowd. Walking along with them was Stanley Conrad.

Stanley was not very different from anyone else in the town, his uniqueness lay with the fact that there was nothing unique about him. He was a fine worker, possibly the best there was - unquestioning, diligent, desperate - but . Walking along the dark streets, he peered into the glass windows of shops on either side, knowing that he would be unable to purchase any of the vanities that he found within. Clutching his pay for today in his hand, he would scurry home, as he had every other day, hoping that no trouble would befall him.

Conrad had lived in this town, which would have no name, for his entire life, unable to escape the shackles of his family's debt. Despite his downcomings, he had been able to have a family, of which he worked desperatly, day and night, to keep together. He was an optimistic man, and went to his work everyday, believing that that day might be the day where he would strike gold, and that everything would work out for him. He would have drank away his problems along with his fellow miners, but he lacked the money to do so, as, despite being the most diligent miners in the town, he was never paid equally with his friends, forever keeping him and his family in debt.
