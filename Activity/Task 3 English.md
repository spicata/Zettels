## Transcript
Where would we be without curiosity. Curiosity spurred Isaac Newton into inventing the Laws of Motion, Thomas Edison's light bulb, Becquerel's photovoltaic cell. Without it, our modern world as we know it would not exist. Despite this, I don't believe that curiosity is a completely positive trait.

First, before we get into anything, what is curiosity? As Oxford Dictionary puts it, curiosity is a "strong desire to know or learn something". However, many researchers use George Loewenstein's definition of curiosity as "a cognitive induced deprivation that arises from the perception of a gap in knowledge and understanding."

Now that that's out of the way, here are the reasons I believe that curiosity is [not okey dokey]



### The Pandora Effect.
The Pandora Effect 
Christopher K.Hsee, from the Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, and Bowen Ruan, from the Wisconsin School of Business, was responsible for coining the term "The Pandora Effect", and have done many experiments regarding this topic.
They predicted that the human mind, when faced with uncertainty or a lack of knowledge, would act to fll that gap, causing them to "open the box", much like Pandora, even under ominous circumstances.
Previous studies have found that curiosity can drive people to seek miserable experiences, such as traversing dangerous terrain, and trying harmful drugs. These experiments were un-controlled.
Hsee and Ruan set up an experiment where students was given 10 pens. However some student recieved colour-coded pens, 5 red, 5 green. Other student were given uncertain pens, 10 yellow.
The green pens would never shock. The red pens would always shock. And the 10 yellow pens are random.
It was found that students with the yellow pens clicked them more than the students with the green and red pens.
### Curiosity and Distraction
Curiosity and distraction are similar. 
Curiosity in what you are doing can benefit you, but being curious in something else acts as a hinderance and a distraction. 
Are you really curious about this new movie in a triology that you've never watched? Are you really curious what is on Facebook Marketplace? Or are you just being distracted from that English Task you are yet to start.
If you are interested in a different thing, sure you are curious, but you are also distracted from your current task.
For a straight-forward task, this manifests itself as a distraction.
Keeping this curiosity in check is important. Curiosity may show your dissinterest in the task, and show your willingness to do something else, however, at many times, that simply is not possible, and trying to do something else will just act as a distraction.
### Adverse Curiosity
Curiosity can make you feel unwell. As NPR discusses, it just a matter of time. If your curiosity is filled soon, you'll focus on the fact that you'll learn something. If your curiosity isn't going to be filled any time soon, you'll focus on the fact that you don't know it.
### Take Away
Control your curiosity, don't let it control you. Use it if you can, ignore it if you can't. Do you need it now, or is it just something to distract you.
