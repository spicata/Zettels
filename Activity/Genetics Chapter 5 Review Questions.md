# Genetics Chapter 5 Review Questions
1. Describe the relationship between the following terms:
	1. Gene and allele
		1. A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for certain polypeptides, creating traits.
		2. Alleles are different forms of the same gene.
	2. Genotype and allele
		1. A genotype is the genetic composition of an organism, the set of alleles that it has.
	3. Genotype and Phenotype
		1. A phenotype is the observable traits of an organism, shaped by the genotype.
2. Match each item in the first column with descriptions in the second column

Term | Description
--- | ---
Heterozygous | Two different genes are present for a particular gene locus
Homozygous | Two copies of the same allele are present for a particular gene locus
Recessive | Two copies of the allele are required for the phenotype to be observed
Dominant | Only one copy of the allele is required for the phenotype to be observed
Codominant | Two different alleles are both fully expressed in the phenotype
Partially Dominant | The phenotype is intermediate between each of those determined by the two different alleles

3. Explain what pure breeding means. Why was it important for Mendel to use pure-breeding plants in his experiments
	1. Pure-breeding means that the pair of alleles are identical (homozygous)
	2. It was important that he did as so to avoid the appearance of unwanted and unexpected traits in an offspring
4. Explain why siblings are not identical, even though they inherit their chromosomes from the same parents.
	1. Because gametes undergo meiosis, which creates genetic variation.
	2. They may inherit either the dominant or recessive gene, differentiating their phenotypes.
5. Explain why none of the offspring of a tall pea plant and short pea plants are of intermediate height.
	1. Because the tall allele is dominant, and the short allele is recessive, meaning that instead of combining, the tall allele simply masked the phenotypes of the short allele.
9. Some fruit flies carry an X-linked recessive gene for white eye colour, over which the red-eyed phenotype is dominant.
	1. What
10. In mice, coat colour is determined by an autosomal gene, and pink coat colour is dominant to brown.
	1. For females: 100% Normal Pinks
	2. For males: 100% Dwarf males
