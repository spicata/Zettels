[[Essays]] [[Draft Day 4]]

~~The world, today, stand on a delicate tightrope of peace, and we are threating to cut the ends. We are in a time when a single bomb can destroy entire cities, and chemicals can be manipulated to our will. We simply cannot afford to start another World War.~~

==Everyone== stands on an infinitely long and delicate tightrope of peace, staying in the own position, and trying not to debalance those around them. ==Everyone== is especially careful and doing their part to keep others safe. All except one, who, swinging wildly on the string with scissors in hand, threatens to cut it in half.

It only takes one to destroy peace, and in a time where a single bomb can destroy entire cities, where a single batch of chemicals can kill thousands of people, where a single sentence can be echoed forever, that is especially true. 
In this day and age, we simply cannot afford to start another World War. The ensuing destruction is too great.

Our adversary's control over their own country is tentative at best, and their threat to us is non-existant.

Their plans are thwarted by an unruly public. Their population lay discontent with their leadership. There is disharmony within their ranks. The corrupt, self serving politicians argue and bicker amongst themselves. Their leaders cannot come to a consensus on anything.

No political developments occur there, no social developments occur there, no military developments occur there. We do not need to be worried, as they are not a threat.

Even when they come to an eventual decision, they cannot act upon it. There economy is in ruins due to years of civil war and harsh global sanction. Their government reserves and national banks lack funds, and infrastructure required to harvest their natural resources where destroyed.

They cannot financially support their claims, nor the actions they will take.

Their stockpiles of weaponry are depleted, their men's moral is shattered. Their best fighters were killed in their own war. They have no long range missles as our government claims.

So is the war worth it? Is it worth it to engage in a battle against a country that cannot control anything?

And if this war is carried out, we will just be wasting resources and valuable human lives.

It will be taking millions, maybe billions of dollars from vital government programs and agencies. From our healthcare, our police, our education. If we spend our money on this meaningless war, people who need the money will not be able to get it. Even if your not fighting in the war, you will still feel the consequences of it at home.

And those who fight in the war will have to face the young, inexperienced men, sent by the government, which they so despise, to protect their own country. Many of our men will be wounded forever, some will pass. Blood will be spilt on this unneccessary war.

So is the war worth it? Is it worth it to engage in a battle that will drain the money and lives of our society?

And if this war is carried out, we will just be risking the escalation of this conflict.

Our adversary poses no danger to us, but other, larger, stronger countries do. Countries that can wield nuclear bombs and chemical weaponry and propoganda to their benefit. Ones that are not afraid. And if in our invasion, they see us as a large enough threat, they will consider attacking us. 

And these attacks will be ones we have not seen before. The nuclear bombs we have today are not the ones that were dropped 7 decades ago. Our current bombs are much more powerful, and the technology to make them stronger exists. If any country were to detonate one, the damage would be immense.

So is the war worth it? Is it worth it to engage in a battle that has the potential to bring damage that has not been seen before in human history?

The one put his scissors against the tightrope, a blanket of silence falls on everyone. But he hesitates. He realises the destruction this could bring to himself. He pulls back.

It takes just one to bring peace. To realise their mistake. Even if it is in self-interest.

Other countries see us as a bulwark against brutality and as a protector of peace, a model for what their government should be. We should maintain that. We should not blindly follow the easiest route to take, but carefully make our decisions, considering the consequences of our actions, and take a route that would be best. In this day and age, every decision matters.

~~There is disharmony within their ranks, the leaders cannot agree on anything.
Is it worth it to spend millions or billions of dollars to engage in war?~~

~~Our supposed enemies have only recently come out of a bloody civil war, and they are in no position to harm us. 
Their control over their country is tentative at best. Their plans often thwarted by small towns and criminal groups. They argue and bicker within their ranks, their government leaders cannot agree on anything. They are in no position to harm us. 
Their civil war drained their banks and destroyed their natural resources. Their economy is in ruins. Their remaining funds are stolen by corrupt government officials for their own personal gain. They are in no position to harm us.
Their army and stockpiles of weaponry gone. Their men's morale is shattered, the best fighters killed. Their artillery and rockets were destroyed. They are in no position to harm us.~~

~~The war will be a waste of resources and lives.
Our soldiers will be going to gun down their. Both sides will have casualties. Many of our men will be hurt and wounded permantently. Is that worth it?
Is it worth losing billions and trillions of dollars to a war campaign that is unneccessary?
It takes funds from our programs, our healthcare, our police, our social security. It will make the work of our people harder. Is that worth it?~~

~~All this war does, is create larger ones. All it does is escalete this conflict.
Whilst they cannot harm us, but other, larger countries can. Countries that wield nuclear bombs and chemical weaponry. Countries that are unafraid to use them. If they see us as a large enough threat, they will attack us.~~
~~They cannot harm us, but attacking them will cause their people to turn on us. It will sow the seeds of mistrust into them. Some will join terrorist organisations in an attempt to harm us.
They cannot harm us, but declaring war will make any future attempts at peace harder. It will only make pain and suffering continue.~~

~~People will say, as with any war, that this war has its justifications. People will say that this war for the greater good. People will say that this war will prevent tyranny. People will say that this war will end all wars.~~

Does $P(\overline{A\cap B})$ mean "not (A), and not (B)" or "not (A and B)"
$P({A\prime \cap B\prime})$ means "not (A), and not (B)"?
