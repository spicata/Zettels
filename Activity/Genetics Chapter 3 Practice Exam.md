# Genetics Chapter 3 Practice Exam
1. In a DNA molecule, cytosine pairs with:
	1. adenine
	2. ==guanine==
	3. thymine
	4. uracil
2. If 30% of the bases in a DNA molecule are adenine, what percentage will be guanine?
	1. ==20==
	2. 30
	3. 60
	4. 70
3. In protein synthesis, transcription is the process whereby:
	1. ==information in DNA is copied into mRNA==
	2. information in DNA is copied into tRNA
	3. information in RNA is copied into tRNA
	4. information in transfer RNA is copied into mRNA
4. During DNA replication, the two new DNA strands are synthesised from the template strands at the same time. These strands are synthesised:
	1. in the same direction
	2. in opposite directions
	3. ==by RNA polymerase==
	4. by DNA helicase
5. DNA is made of units called nucleotides. Draw and label a diagram of a nucleotide.
6. Questions
	1. List the two sets of complementry base pairs that occur in DNA molecules.
		1. ==Adenine to Thymine, Guanine to Cytosine==
	2. Name the type of chemical bond that links the complementry base pairs in a DNA molecule.
		1. ==Weak Hydrogen Bonds==
	3. Name the base in mRNA that is complementry to thymine to DNA
		1. Adenine. (==Uracil==)
7. Describe the structure of mRNA
	1. ==Single stranded, Uses uracil instead of thymine, **?**==
8. Describe the role of tRNA in protein synthesis
	1. ==tRNA is an RNA molecule that carries specific amino acids that corrospond to its anti-codon==
	2. ==It attaches its anti-codon base to the mRNA codons, bringing the amino acid.==
	3. ==It holds the amino acid until it is bonded to nearby amino acids, forming a peptide==
9. Describe two differences between DNA and RNA molecules.
	1. ==DNA is single stranded, RNA is double stranded.==
	2. ==DNA uses thymine, RNA uses uracil==
10. Describe the structure of DNA and the main steps in DNA replication in a cell
	1. DNA is an antiparallel intertwined double helix of nucleotides connected to its complementry nucleotides with a weak hydrogen bond.
	2. Steps:
		1. DNA Helicase unwinds the DNA strands, and breaks the weak hydrogen bonds between nucleotides, creating a replication fork.
		2. On the leading strand, DNA polymerase works towards the replication.
