P1: Hook in the audience, main points, coup d'etat

Prompt 2 (Darft 1):
"We will protect our people." That's what the government said on the day it was voted in. They said a new era of peace would begin. That war was behind us.
They said they would help us. They are liars!
3 months ago, they began a war to prevent the spread of authoritarianism. Ever since then, we have suffered. We, the people of our country. We, the people who break our backs to survive. We, the people, giving what little money we have to them, who make as fight as they hide.
Today, we have gathered to stop them.

They say that they are stopping future dictators. They tell other countries that "it's for the greater good." And they buy it! They tell us that "The dictators will terrorise us." And we believed them! But it is becoming more and more apparent that they are the real dictators! We see them bomb  cities, full of hundreds, no, thosands, of innocent people. And yet when we get bombed, they act surprised.
howThey say they are stopping future wars, but we've seen that they haven't! They provoked the "dictators" to a point where they believe it is necessary to attack us to survive! This isn't stopping wars. They've lit a forest on fire to prevent fire! It doesn't make sense!
They say that they represent our beliefs, but time and time again it it shown that they don't. They hide in their million dollar bunkers, with years worth of water and rations, whilst us who work and fight for them suffer. 

When we protest peacefully, they send what is left of the army to stop us in our tracks. The roads on which we walked on are tainted permanetly with the blood of our friends and families.

Stuff 
1. The bombings of major cities. How did we get here?
2. Our government
3. The war they started
4. The repercussions

(Darft 2)
Last week, we saw something that should have been left in the past. People died. Buildings left destroyed. Those lucky enough to survive were trapped for days. We are still adding to the death count.
Is this the "peace" that we were promised?
Over these months, we saw thousands of our people go to fight in foreign lands. Gunned down. Bombed. They will never come back.
Is this the "peace" that we were promised?
We have been working unpayed hours to sustain the war effort. To produce weapons to murder more. To escalate the war.
Is this the "peace" that we were promised?
We would see this in George Orwell's dystopian stories. This should not be our reality. There is only one question left to ask. How did we get here?

"We will maintain peace. To protect our people. To protect the world." That was our government's promise. That was our government's plan.
They were willing to give all they got to protect us from an increasingly hostile world. That's what we believed.
They condemned other governments for starting wars. They were a Nobel Prize laureate for peace.

On the first of September however, everything changed.
Our government declared war.
