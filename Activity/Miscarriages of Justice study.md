## Impartial Adjudication
### Beamish
```ad-tldr

Darryl Beamish's appeals were ignored despite the faults in law and new evidence that was uncovered.

```
Mr Beamish states that he had been threatened and intimidated to make his confessions during the police interregations. 
This was a fault in the law, as it was against police conduct and illegal to make threats to force a confession.
```ad-Key

This should have made this piece of evidence inadmissible, which would have rendered the case against Darryl Beamish nigh impossible.

```
Eric Edgar Cooke was later found responsible for the crime that Mr Beamish had been convicted for, when he confessed moments before his hanging.
```ad-quote

“I swear before almighty God that I killed Anderson and Brewer.” - Edgar Cooke

```
Despite this new piece of evidence, the court still ignored Mr Beamish's appeals.
This continued until the Court of Criminal Appeals decided to quash his conviction.
## Hearing Both Parties
### Gibson
```ad-tldr

Gene Gibson was not able properly understand the court process, and was told to plea guilty.

```
Mr Gibson, an Indigenous man who could not understand English well, was not given a proper interpreter and could not express his case to the best of his abilities.
Dominic Brunello, states that he was afraid that the interpreter was not translating Mr Gibson verbatim.
```ad-quote

"more than once there were noticeable differences", "I was concerned about commentary being thrown in there" - Dominic Brunello

```
This also made it more difficult for Mr Gibson to present his case.
Furthermore, the WA Aboriginal Legal Services was said to have been struggling with a shortage of resources.
```ad-quote

"done with more resources" - Dominic Brunello

```
Finally, Mr Gibson was told to plead guilty to avoid "big time" prison and instead have "small time" prison.
This was probably not a fault of the lawyer, but a fault of the translation or the nature of the English to Pintupi translation.
## Evidence-based Decisions
### Beamish
The entire case against Mr Beamish lay entirely with the 4 confessions, 3 said to be forced and the last being a misunderstanding.
Normally this evidence would be rendered inadmissable, as it is a breach of the law, however, 
### Gibson

### Mallard
