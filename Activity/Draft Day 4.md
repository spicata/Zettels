6. Conclusion

The world, today, stand on a delicate tightrope of peace, and we are threating to cut the ends. We are in a time when a single bomb can destroy entire cities, and chemicals can be manipulated to our will. We simply cannot afford to start another World War.

Our supposed enemies have only recently come out of a bloody civil war, and they are in no position to harm us.
Their control over their country is tentative at best. Their plans often thwarted by small towns and criminal groups. They argue and bicker within their ranks, their government leaders cannot agree on anything. They are in no position to harm us. 
Their civil war drained their banks and destroyed their natural resources. Their economy is in ruins. Their remaining funds are stolen by corrupt government officials for their own personal gain. They are in no position to harm us.
Their army and stockpiles of weaponry gone. Their men's morale is shattered, the best fighters killed. Their artillery and rockets were destroyed. They are in no position to harm us.

The war will be a waste of resources and lives.
Our soldiers will be going to gun down their. Both sides will have casualties. Many of our men will be hurt and wounded permantently. Is that worth it?
Is it worth losing billions and trillions of dollars to a war campaign that is unneccessary?
It takes funds from our programs, our healthcare, our police, our social security. It will make the work of our people harder. Is that worth it?

All this war does, is create larger ones. All it does is escalete this conflict.
Whilst they cannot harm us, but other, larger countries can. Countries that wield nuclear bombs and chemical weaponry. Countries that are unafraid to use them. If they see us as a large enough threat, they will attack us.
They cannot harm us, but attacking them will cause their people to turn on us. It will sow the seeds of mistrust into them. Some will join terrorist organisations in an attempt to harm us.
They cannot harm us, but declaring war will make any future attempts at peace harder. It will only make pain and suffering continue.

~~People will say, as with any war, that this war has its justifications. People will say that this war for the greater good. People will say that this war will prevent tyranny. People will say that this war will end all wars.~~
