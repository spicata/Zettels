# Genetics Activity 5.8
1. Define:
	1. Autosomal
		1. Relating to the autosomes
		2. An allele on the autosome
	2. Sex-linked inheritance
		1. A trait that is passed down on one of the sex-chromosomes
	3. X-linked inheritance
		1. A sex-linked trait that is present on the X chromosome
	4. Y-linked inheritance
		1. A sex-linked trait that is present on the Y chromosome
2. Define carrier:
	1. A carrier is a person that can pass on a trait to a future generation, especially without suffering from it themselves.
3. Describe and explain:
	1. X-linked recessive
		1. X-linked recessive is a type of inheritance that is passed down on the X chromosome, and is recessive.
	2. X-linked dominant
		1. X-linked dominant is a type of inheritance that is passed down on the X chromosome, and is dominant.
	3. Y-linked
		1. Y-linked is a type of inheritance that is passed down on the Y chromosome. Due to this, there is no dominant or recessive, as nobody* can have more than one Y chromosome, and this trait can only affect males.
4. Ichthyosis
	1. What might account for the differences in occurrence of this type of ichthyosis between males and females.
		1. It is possible that this type of ichthyosis is a Y-linked trait, and thus doesn't affect females.
	2. From which parent would an affected male have inherited this condition
		1. Assuming that it is a Y-linked trait, it is only possible for the parent from which the trait is inherited to be their dad.
	3. What is the probability the affected male would pass down this trait to his sons.
		1. It would be 100% because the only Y chromosome that could be passed down is the fathers.
5. Xg blood group
	1. Explain how an X-linked phenotype could be observed equally in both sexes.
		1. It could be that this allele is dominant, which would mean that, since it will hide the other allele anyways, it could be equally likely in both sexes.
	2. What is the probability?
		1. Assuming that it is a dominant trait, there is a 50% chance that the son will show the trait and there is a 50% chance that the daughter will show the trait.
	3. What is the probability?
		1. Assuming that it is a dominant trait, there is a 0% chance that the son will show the trait and there is a 100% chance that the daughter will show the trait.
6. Which pedigree?
	1. Autosomal recessive
7. What genotypes do i2, and ii4 have?
	1. Ff and ff
