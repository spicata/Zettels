# Mechanisms of Evolution
```ad-important

The 4 mechanisms of evolution is: Mutation, Natural Selection, Genetic Drift, Migration enabling gene flow.

```
## Mutation
A mutation is a source of new alleles in a population's gene pool.
A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA sequence of a gene. A mutation can change on allele to another, but the net effect is a change in the frequency of a existing allele.
The change in frequency is often insignificant.
### Selection pressure
A selection pressure is an environmental factor that can be survived by those individuals in a population who possess a beneficial trait, but not others.
```ad-example

- Presence of food/prey/shelter (resources)
- Temperature, water availability, pH (abiotic factors)
- Pathogens, diseases, and predators (biotic factors)

```
## Natural Selection

Natural selection occurs when selection pressures in the environment confer a selective advantage ocer a specific phenotype to enhance its survival and reproductions.
It leads to changes in allele frequency in the gene pool of a population.
Individuals that have certain inherited traits are more likely to survive and reproduce at higher rates than other individuals.
### Principles
#### Principle 1: Variation
Individuals in a population differ from one another; that is, individual within populations show variation.
#### Principle 2: Overproduction
There are more individuals produced in a population than the environment can support. Not all individuals can survive to reproduce. Only occurs when there is a limited resource.
#### Principle 3: Competition and Survival of the Fittest
Environmental selection pressures such as food availability, predators, and some diseases favour those with more **advantageous traits/alleles**.
#### Principle 4: Higher Reproductive Rate
Individuals that have an advantageous allele are more likely to survive and to reproduce.
#### Principle 5: Heritability
Advantageous alleles are heritable.
More likely to pass on alleles.
#### Principle 6: Allele Frequency Change
Over consecutive generations, the frequency of the advantageous alles increases.
